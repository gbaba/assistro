original intentions of the parties, and the remaining segments shall
continue in full effect. Assistro may assign, sublicense or pledge
any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a

waived except by a written instrument expressly waiving such
provision and signed by a duly authorized officer of Assistro. By

Australia without regard to any principles of conflicts of law, will
apply to all matters related to the use of the Service, and you
further agree that any litigation shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts. The failure of Assistro
to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service
does not establish a waiver of such right or provision.

cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service, the
Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy must be filed within one year
after the event giving rise to such claim or cause of action or be
