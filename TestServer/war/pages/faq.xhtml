					Installation is very simple! After signing up you will be given
					access to the assistro dashboard so you can customize your chat
					window. You will then be given a code to copy/paste onto your
					website. That’s it! Installation takes around 30 seconds, and you
					don’t need any coding or technical experience at all. <br> </br>

			<div class="technology" id="about">How does Assistro work?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
					Assistro is <B>live chat</B> software that enables website owners to
				engage with their website visitors in <B>real time</B>. After
				installing our code on your site, assistro will begin working
				immediately. When a customer comes to your website, the
				assistro chat window will automatically appear after 10 seconds
				inviting them to engage with you. If your customers have questions, they
				can respond to the <b>proactive</b> chat message and that will initiate a
				live chat session with one of your operators.<br/><br/>As your customer browses through
				your website the chat message will appear on each page so they can
				continue to chat with the operator and receive assistance as
				required.
				</p>
				</section>
			</div>

			<div class="technology" id="about">So why choose Assistro and not any other real-time live chat?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				There are other chat programs
				out there – but we are confident that assistro offers you the best
				features and the best price. Many of our competitors’ software
				doesn’t work on iPads or iPhones, and doesn’t allow for proactive
				messaging to your web visitors. When building assistro, we looked at
				all the options available and chose the best features from each to
				make our software. Best of all, our pricing is 30%-70% cheaper!

			<div class="technology" id="about">What do my visitors need to for them to use Assistro?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
					Absolutely nothing! Well, a
				modern web browser does help (modern browsers are JavaScript
				enabled) but other than that they just need to visit your site and
				experience the awesomeness of your customer service now that you
				have assistro on your team.

			<div class="technology" id="about">Does Assistro support my language characters set?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				The answer is YES. Assistro
				enables you to chat with your visitors/customers using any UTF-8
				characters<br></br>Currently, the assistro site is
				only available in English, however once installed, there is no
				limitation on which language characters you can use to chat with your
				web visitors.

			<div class="technology" id="about">What instant messenger software should I use with Assistro?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				One of assistro’s strengths is that we operate through <A HREF="http://www.google.com/talk" onclick="return ! window.open(this.href);">Google Talk</A>.
				Many of our customers simply use the Google Talk chat widgets, but
				we prefer to use messenger programs such as <A
					HREF="http://www.ebuddy.com" onclick="return ! window.open(this.href);">eBuddy</A> or
				<A HREF="http://www.pidgin.im" onclick="return ! window.open(this.href);">Pidgin</A> – especially
				useful if you have assistro installed on multiple sites.

			<div class="technology" id="about">I thought Assistro is automatic but why when I visit the
					Website it does not automatically pop up?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				Perhaps the agents are offline.
				When it is on Offline Mode, it will not open unless it is clicked.
				Otherwise, it automatically pops up after ten (10) seconds.
				</p>
				</section>
			</div>
			
			<div class="technology" id="about">What if I want to close the chat window?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				Assistro’s chat window pops up
				after ten (10) seconds of someone being on the site. Your visitors
				have the option to respond, ignore, minimize or close it. Assistro
				no longer prompts those who have already closed the chat box on your
				Website.

				</section>
			</div>
			
			<div class="technology" id="about">Can I put Assistro on more than one (1) Website?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				Absolutely! You can copy/paste
				your assistro code on to as many web sites as you like. You're only
				limited by how many chat request you can handle at one time.

			<div class="technology" id="about">I can’t be in the office all the time, what happens when I’m
					mobile?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				We get asked this question a
				lot. One of the biggest advantages of using assistro is the ability
				to chat with web visitors from your smartphone or tablet device.
				Simply visit the appstore or Android store and download one of the
				many Google Talk apps (we recommend eBuddy or Pidgin) and you can
				then send and receive chat messages while on the go!

			<div class="technology" id="about">I can’t be online all the time, what happens when I’m
					offline?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				When all your operators are
				offline, assistro is offline. The offline mode will display the
				assistro widget in a minimized window on your website. Your web
				visitors can still choose to send you an email via assistro when you
				are offline so that you do not miss out on any potential enquiries.

			<div class="technology" id="about">What browser should I and my visitors use with Assistro?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				Good news is Assistro is
				compatible with all common browsers. You can use Microsoft Internet
				Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome and Opera and
				all their respective newer versions.

			<div class="technology" id="about">Can I use Assistro on handheld phones?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				One major benefit of Assistro is
				that you can use it even if you are not in the office. You can chat
				with your website visitors via your mobile phone. We are using
				Assistro on iPhone and Android. You just need to download an
				application from iTunes or from the Android Store. We recommend
				eBuddy or Pidgin, or Google’s own Gtalk! App.

			<div class="technology" id="about">Is FLYING SOLO package really free?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">

				like to own and operate a small business, that’s why we have created
				a free version for micro businesses to take advantage of. Our
				“flying solo” package is limited to one operator and 10

			<div class="technology" id="about">I cannot decide what package is best for me, how can I choose
					the right one?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="thelanguage">
				<section class="answer">
				<p>
				All packages (except for Flying
				Solo which is free) include 15-day trial. Thus signing up or testing
				the right one for you is risk free. Likewise, if you cancel before
				the first fifteen (15) days, you will not be charged.
